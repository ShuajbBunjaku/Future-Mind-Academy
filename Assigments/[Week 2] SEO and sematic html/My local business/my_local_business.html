            <h2>Burger King</h2>
            <p> Burger King Corporation (BK), known as Hungry Jack's in Australia, is an American-based multinational
                chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was
                founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Florida-based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger
                King ran into financial difficulties, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton (1927-2018) and
                James McLamore (1926-1996) purchased the company in 1959 and renamed it "Burger King".Over the next
                half-century, the company hands four times and its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG
                Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, took it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G
                Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new
                owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with partner
                Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons,
                under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.</p>

            <h2 id="H1">History</h2>
            <p>The predecessor to Burger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King.
                After visiting the McDonald brothers' original store location in San Bernardino, California, the
                founders and owners (Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns), who had purchased the rights
                to two pieces of equipment called "Insta-machines", opened their first restaurants. Their production
                model was based on one of the machines they had acquired, an oven called the "Insta-Broiler". This
                strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the
                device. After the company faltered in 1959, it was purchased by its Miami, Florida, franchisees,
                James McLamore and David R. Edgerton. They initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain, first
                renaming the company Burger King. They ran the company as an independent entity for eight years
                (eventually expanding to over 250 locations in the United States), before selling it to the Pillsbury
                Company in 1967.

        <section> Pillsbury's management tried several times to restructure Burger King during the late 1970s and the
            early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N.
            Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called "Operation Phoenix", Smith restructured
            corporate business practices at all levels of the company. Changes included updated franchise
            agreements, a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs. Smith left Burger
            King for PepsiCo in 1980 shortly before a system-wide decline in sales..</p>

            <h2 id="SAD">Structure And Operations</h2>
            <p>Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King, also known as Burger King Corporation and
                abbreviated BKC, and is a Delaware corporation formed on July 23, 2002. A subsidiary, it derives its
                income from several sources, including property rental and sales through company owned restaurants
                however, a substantial portion of its revenue is dependent on franchise fees. During the
                transitional period after the acquisition of the company by 3G Capital, Burger King's board of directors
                was co-chaired by John W. Chidsey, formerly CEO and chairman of the company, and Alex Behring, managing
                partner of 3G Capital. By April 2011, the new ownership completed the restructuring of Burger King's
                corporate management and Chidsey tendered his resignation, leaving Behring as CEO and chair.</p>

            <h2 id="IO">International Operation</h2>
            <p>While BK began its foray into locations outside of the continental United States in 1963 with a store in
                San Juan, Puerto Rico, it did not have an international presence until several years later. Shortly
                after the acquisition of the chain by Pillsbury, it opened its first Canadian restaurant in Windsor,
                Ontario in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after, including Australia in
                1971, with a restaurant in the Perth suburb of Innaloo, and Europe in 1975, with a restaurant in
                Madrid. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several East Asian
                countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. Due to high competition, all of the
                Japanese locations were closed in 2001; however, BK reentered the Japanese market in June 2007.
                BK's Central and South American operations began in Mexico in the late 1970s and by the early 1980s in
                Caracas, Venezuela, Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. While Burger King lags behind
                McDonald's in international locations by over 12,000 stores, as of 2008 it had managed to become the
                largest chain in several countries including Mexico and Spain. The company divides its
                international operations into three segments; the Middle East, Europe and Africa division (EMEA),
                Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). In each of these regions, Burger
                King has established several subsidiaries to develop strategic partnerships and alliances to expand into
                new territories. In its EMEA group, Burger King's Switzerland-based subsidiary Burger King Europe GmbH
                is responsible for the licensing and development of BK franchises in those regions.Exhibit
                In APAC region, the Singapore-based BK AsiaPac, Pte. Ltd. business unit handles franchising
                for East Asia, the Asian subcontinent and all Oceanic territories. The
                LAC region includes Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean Islands and has no centralized
                operations group.</p>
